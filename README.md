## Instructions 

- Fork this github repository for writing code and send us link
- Commit your changes periodically during development and update the todos in the readme by changing [ ] to [x] after every respective task is completed.

### Challenge

TODO:

### Evaluation

Our goal is to find answers to those questions:

- Do you understand the JavaScript language and more in general web technologies?

- Can you judge which library/framework is the best fit for a job and use it correctly?

- Can you design interfaces that are clear and easy to use?

- Do you master your working environment?


#### Due to the limited time consider the followings

- It is NOT important to have a fully functional application at the end.

- You can develop just for the latest version of Google Chrome.
