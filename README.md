### Evaluation

- Our goal is to find answers to those questions:

- Do you understand the JavaScript language and more in general web technologies?

- Can you judge which library/framework is the best fit for a job and use it correctly?

- Can you design interfaces that are clear and easy to use?

- Do you master your working environment?


#### Due to the limited time consider the followings:

It is NOT important to have a fully functional application at the end.

We'll develop just for the latest version of Google Chrome.
